# Luhn-Algorithm-Python-Project
### About This Repository
I independently completed freeCodeCamp's [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) certification, to invest in my scientific computing skills with Python. This repository contains my independent problem-solving work as part of the first project in this curriculum. I devised two scripts for this ([Caesar-cipher.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Caesar-Cipher-String-Manipulation-Python-Project/blob/main/Caesar-cipher.py) and [Vigenere-cipher.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Caesar-Cipher-String-Manipulation-Python-Project/blob/main/Vigenere-cipher.py)), which used Python to produce Caesar and Vigenre ciphers respectively. These two cipher functions took and encoded input strings into cipher messages, by shifting the characters in the strings `n` letters forward in the alphabet. `n` was constant in the Caesar cipher and variable in the Vigenre cipher. The latter function could also be used to decipher encoded messages. I produced in-depth problem-solving thought process notes when coding these functions, which are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Caesar-Cipher-String-Manipulation-Python-Project/blob/main/Cipher%20Problem%20Solving%20Thought%20Process%20Notes.txt). This enabled me to invest in my function writing and string manipulation skills with Python, marking the completion of the first project in the course.
