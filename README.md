# Luhn-Algorithm-Python-Project
### About This Repository
I independently completed freeCodeCamp's [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) certification, to invest in my scientific computing skills with Python. This repository contains my independent problem-solving work as part of the second project in this curriculum. I devised a script for this ([verify_card_number.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Luhn-Algorithm-Python-Project/blob/main/verify_card_number.py)), which used Python to apply the Luhn algorithm - for credit card number validation. This defined two functions, `verify_card_number`, which took a 'credit card' number and applied the Luhn algorithm to this - to determine if it was valid or not, by returning a boolean value. The project .py file includes in-depth problem solving approaches used to achieve this, and my project [Luhn Algorithm Problem Solving Thought Process Notes.txt](https://github.com/franpanteli/Luhn-Algorithm-Python-Project/blob/main/Luhn%20Algorithm%20Problem%20Solving%20Thought%20Process%20Notes.txt) notes have more information regarding this. The second function the project Python function defined, the `main` function, tested this credit card validation function on a dummy credit card number. This enabled me to invest in my function writing and algorithm application manipulation skills with Python, marking the sucessful completion of the second project in the course.
